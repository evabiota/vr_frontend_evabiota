# Overview
We would like you to code a single responsive page  without any backend. Below are the specs, followed by the design.

I comment some aspects of the decisions I had to take here:


## Specs
- The design consists of 3 "views" small (320px to 640px), medium (641px to 1024px), large (1025px and above)
- The page content doesn't expand above 1400px and the minimum supported width is 320px
- On small view:
  * The header stays always visible at the top of the page. 
  * Clicking the download button reveals the download options menu/dropdown.
  * Clicking the "burger" menu reveals the navigation links.
	all OK
- All the links point to "#"
- Page should look acceptable on IE10/IE11.
	I used the -ms prefix for flex boxes.
- The page font is Roboto,
	I imported the google font in styles.css
- Element spacing doesn't have to be pixel perfect but it should be close to the design:
	It’s very close actually.
- Social media icons can be replaced with different ones.
	I changed some of them.

# Other

- Please don't use any libraries or frameworks (jquery, bootstrap, angular, react). 
	I didn’t.
- Please don't use any front-end template engines. 
	I didn’t.
- Usage of bundlers, CSS preprocessors and task runners is encouraged: 
	I didn’t use any, I did it so fast so I used css instead. I build it without think before in any 	strategy. Step by step without stop or redo anything. Less time.
- Please provide a short summary detailing anything you think is relevant, for _example_:
  - Installation steps
  - How to run your code
  - What would you have done differently if you had had more time
  - Etc.
 	I would had used scss or sass instead, I would I used BEM, but I didn’t use it before so there was no time to learn in this occasion 
- Please send your results as a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle).
	I ‘ve never used it before and I didn’t have time to read the documentation. I sent to my 		repository on Github instead.
